insert their 6 character unique business key, select the style they want to use, and paste the [schedule_now] 
shortcode into a page or post. If they don't already have a Schedulicity account, they are eligible for a 
30 day free trial via the link provided on the plugin home page.

After finishing the start up for schedulicity & fb page it was as late as 7:00 pm before I sent out my email announcements. It's 10 pm now & just had my 5th booking. $$$ This will be great!
